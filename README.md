# sensor_fuion_udacity
my own porject code answer and some thoughts on the project on the sensor fusion nanoprogram

# destination
I see there are official code on the big project of the program, but there is no detail on the lesson project and other code. I try to sort out them and add some my own thought on the program when learning.

优达学城官方对于课程大作业都有自己的源代码，但是对于随堂作业没有源代码并且工作区域写起来比较麻烦，所以笔者做了这些代码的整理并加入了一些自己的思考。

# content project
